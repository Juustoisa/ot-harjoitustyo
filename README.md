**As of 27.04:**
Couldn't allocate much time to project, improved tests and validations.

**As of 20.04:**
Project has been changed to use GUI, took longer than expected, ability to add teas to database has been added. Checkstyle has been implemented. Pretty slow progress for now.

**As of 13.04:**
Project has been started, there's some basic skeletons in place, mut not much functionality yet. By choosing to add a new tea to the database a placeholder will be saved and all the saved placeholders can be listed. The ui is text-based for now.
